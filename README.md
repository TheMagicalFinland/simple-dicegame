# simple-dicegame
A school task I improved.

This project was a task provided by my software development studies. The task was to add two generators and make them generate a number together by clicking on a button. I assume they did not expect this kind of project return.

I improved the task given by actually visual dices and making the dices roll realistically in a way like a game made for children. It also plays sound effects, which you can locate from the sound effect folder.

If the result of the dices is lower or equal to three, a sad tambourine is played.

Made with mostly JavaScript. Has mixing of html and css though for visual sights.
